# Recombee Test Task
#### React Application

This code challenge provided a paginated list returned from a Rails backend that is consumed on the front end with React. Using Recombee's cloud service, I seeded the catalog with sample database information(movies and ratings for said movies). 

Upon displaying the movie cards, a user can page through the api return with the next and previous buttons, 50 at a time. Inside each card, a link `Recommendations` links to the `/recommendations` page. In that page the user is provided with a list of 5 movie recommendations based on Recommbee's machine learning recommendation system.
